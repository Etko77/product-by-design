Measurement-based 3D Model Generation: Users input their body measurements, and the system generates a unique 3D model of the clothing item.

Interactive 3D Viewer: View the generated design in real-time, allowing rotation, zoom, and detailed inspection of the garment.

Customizable Clothing Types: The application can create various types of clothing items (e.g., shirts, pants, jackets) based on the provided measurements.
